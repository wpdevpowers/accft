Changes the color of your ACF fields when editing Field Groups based on their field type, making them much easier to sort and tell apart.


== Description ==

This plugin changes the color that fields appear when editing ACF field groups in the backend based on their field type, making them much easier to sort and tell apart. It also makes it much easier to re-arrange your fields if you zoom out the page to view more fields at a time. The Pro version also adds an icon to fields that have conditional logic enabled and adds styling to fields that have start and end points to make it easier to tell where they start and end.


== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
